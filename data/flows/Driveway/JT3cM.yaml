story:
- Lawrence Butler had just arrived home from a long day at work. He pulled into his
  driveway, which was situated between two tall trees that made it hard to see the
  neighboring properties. He put his car in park and was just about to get out when
  he realized that he had forgotten to check his mailbox.
- He put the car back in drive and began backing up slowly. At that moment, Richard
  Hunter was driving down the street, trying to find the right house for his job.
  He saw Lawrence's car backing out of the driveway and slowed down to give him room.
- Lawrence continued to back up, but he didn't see Richard's Porsche 911 driving behind
  him. Suddenly, there was a loud crunching sound as Lawrence's yellow sedan hit the
  front left side of Richard's luxury car.
- The impact caused Lawrence's car to jolt forward, and he immediately hit the horn
  to alert anyone nearby. Thankfully, there were no pedestrians or other vehicles
  on the street at the time.
- Lawrence quickly got out of his car to check on Richard and assess the damage. Richard
  also got out of his vehicle, and they both surveyed the scene.
- There was significant damage to both vehicles with Lawrence's car's front right
  side and Richard's Porsche's front left side being damaged badly. Lawrence had one
  passenger in his car - his young daughter - who was shaken up but thankfully not
  injured.
- Richard had no passengers in his car at the time of the accident, but he had a few
  witnesses who saw the accident happen from across the street. They ran over to offer
  assistance and make sure everyone involved was okay.
- Lawrence felt terrible about what had happened and apologized profusely to Richard
  and his witnesses. They exchanged contact information, and Richard called the police
  department to report the accident.
- A few minutes later, a police officer arrived on the scene to assess what had happened.
  Unfortunately, there were no cameras around to provide video evidence of the accident,
  but both drivers and witnesses cooperated with the officer to give their accounts
  of what had happened.
- After the police officer had finished taking statements from everyone involved,
  he informed them that no tickets or citations would be issued. Lawrence felt relieved
  but still guilty about the damage caused by the accident.
- Richard felt a little frustrated that he would now have to deal with repairs to
  his car, but he was also grateful that nobody had been seriously hurt in the accident.
  He was more concerned about his slight neck injury and scheduled an X-ray to see
  if there were any fractures or serious damage to his spine.
- Meanwhile, Lawrence
