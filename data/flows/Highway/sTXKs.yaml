story:
- Ruth had been driving on the four-lane highway for about 30 minutes. The yellow
  light ahead of her signaled that she needed to turn left to get to the hospital
  where her husband was checked in. Ruth double-checked the traffic flow before making
  a left. As she began her turn, she noticed a brown GMC Yukon headed straight for
  her.
- The other driver, James Mccloud, was traveling forward and had failed to see Ruth's
  car turning left. Ruth hit the brakes as soon as she saw James approaching, but
  it was too late. James slammed into the back of Ruth's yellow car, sending it spinning
  out of control.
- Ruth was frightened and disoriented as the impact of the crash rattled her head.
  She felt a sharp pain in her forehead and blood trickling down her face. All she
  could think of was her husband's condition and how she had to reach him immediately.
- As cars screeched to a halt all around them, Ruth tried to gather her thoughts while
  surveying the damage to her car. The back of her car had caved in, and it was clear
  that it was not drivable any longer. As James got out of his car, Ruth could see
  that he too was visibly shaken by the accident.
- The police were called by another driver who witnessed the crash and stopped to
  help and direct traffic. They arrived on the scene shortly, but before they could
  ask any questions, Ruth frantically explained that she needed to get to the hospital
  urgently.
- The police officers were kind and took quick action to ensure that Ruth's needs
  were met. They guided traffic around the accident site and assisted with making
  arrangements for a tow truck. As they waited for the tow truck, Ruth saw that there
  were several witnesses who were willing to share their accounts of what happened.
  One witness even shared a dashcam video that clearly showed that James was distracted
  by an animal on the road at the time of the crash.
- Despite the evidence against him, James disputed fault and refused to admit that
  he was responsible for the accident. The police officers could not issue a citation
  as they did not witness the accident, but they gave Ruth a copy of the police report
  for her insurance claim.
- It was a traumatic experience for Ruth, and she was worried about the mounting expenses
  it would take to cover her medical bills and repair her car. Fortunately, she had
  collision insurance, uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, and MedPay. These
  coverages helped ease the financial burden that comes with an unexpected accident.
