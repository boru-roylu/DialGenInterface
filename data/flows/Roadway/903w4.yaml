story:
- Jesus Godbee was on his way to the bank to deposit his workout earnings when he
  suddenly heard a loud noise. He looked at his side mirror and saw another car hitting
  his front right side. He quickly pulled off the road and got out of his navy blue
  sedan. He could hear the screams of his passengers, who were still inside the car,
  and he immediately checked on them.
- Jesus was relieved when he found out that everyone in his car was fine, but he was
  worried about what happened to the other driver. He saw a beige Land Rover LR4 several
  meters away from his car, and it seemed like the driver was also in a state of shock.
- He approached the other driver named Melissa Williams, who seemed to have injured
  her limb. She had a cut scratch and needed medical attention. Jesus immediately
  called for an ambulance while he waited for the paramedics to arrive, he tried to
  calm Melissa down by asking her some questions about what happened.
- Melissa mentioned that she was turning onto the turn lane when she saw Jesus's car
  backing out of a parking space. She hit the brakes but it was too late, and she
  ended up hitting Jesus's car. Melissa also mentioned that the road condition was
  slippery, which may have contributed to the accident.
- Jesus recalled that he wasn't backing up, but rather changing lanes to avoid an
  obstruction to his view. He explained this to Melissa, but she was in pain and couldn't
  concentrate. Fortunately, witnesses nearby confirmed what Jesus said. They saw Melissa's
  Land Rover suddenly swerve towards Jesus's car without any apparent reason.
- The witnesses also mentioned that the traffic conditions were heavy at that time
  with a steep incline, and there was no traffic signal in the area. The road had
  three lanes with an additional turn lane, which made it difficult for drivers to
  see each other especially if there were obstructions along the way.
- Jesus and Melissa didn't exchange any tickets or citations since there was no police
  report filed. Jesus tried to be understanding and didn't blame Melissa for what
  happened. However, he was distraught after seeing the damage on his car. The front
  right part of his car was severely damaged, and it might take a hefty sum of money
  to repair it.
- Melissa's Land Rover had damage on the right side, but it wasn't as severe as Jesus's
  car. Her car was newer and more expensive than Jesus's, which made him feel even
  worse since he didn't want to cause anyone trouble.
- After the paramedics arrived, they took Melissa to the hospital to treat her injuries
