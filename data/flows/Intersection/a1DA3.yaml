story:
- Andrew Joy had just left the gas station and was on his way to the pharmacy when
  he approached the intersection of Elm Street and Pine Avenue. The traffic signal
  at the intersection was a stop sign and Andrew made sure to come to a complete stop
  before continuing through the intersection. However, as he began to pull forward,
  he suddenly felt a jolt and heard a loud crashing sound.
- Andrew's teal sedan had been struck on the front right side by a light blue Mazda
  that was traveling down Pine Avenue. The impact caused Andrew's car to spin around,
  leaving it facing the opposite direction. He was stunned and a little disoriented
  but soon realized that he had escaped without injury.
- Andrew quickly checked to see if there were any passengers in his car, but all he
  saw were a few items that had been knocked onto the floor during the collision.
  He then looked out the window and saw that the other driver, Linda Riddle, had also
  stopped her vehicle. She appeared to be uninjured but he couldn't tell if there
  were any passengers in her car.
- Andrew got out of his car and approached Linda's vehicle to assess the damage. He
  noticed that her car had hit him in the back and it was clear that both cars had
  sustained significant damage. Andrew tried to remain calm and collected as he asked
  Linda if she was okay. She replied that she was sore but didn't seem seriously injured.
- As they proceeded to exchange information, Andrew noticed that Linda seemed agitated
  and a little disoriented. When he asked her what happened, she admitted that she
  wasn't sure. She said that she vaguely remembered honking her horn before hitting
  his car, but couldn't remember why.
- They didn't have any witnesses to confirm what happened, so Andrew called the police
  to report the accident. The police arrived within minutes and began their investigation.
- The officer who arrived on scene made sure both drivers were alright before examining
  the cars for damages. He found skid marks on the road leading up to the intersection
  from Linda's vehicle, suggesting she had either been traveling too fast or was unable
  to brake in time. The officer also noted debris on the road, which might have contributed
  to the accident.
- The officer questioned both drivers and took down their accounts of what happened.
  Andrew explained that he had come to a complete stop at the intersection before
  continuing through, while Linda couldn't remember why she honked her horn and hit
  Andrew's car. The officer also checked for any traffic citations or tickets, but
  none were issued at the scene.
