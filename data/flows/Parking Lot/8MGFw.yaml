story:
- James Munter was on his way to the library to pick up some books for his research
  when he decided to make a quick stop at the Home Depot to grab some gardening supplies.
  James had been driving for almost an hour when finally saw the parking lot of the
  store. He found a spot near the back of the parking lot and began backing into it.
- Suddenly, he felt a jolt and heard a loud thud. James quickly turned around to see
  what had happened and noticed that another car had hit his vehicle. The impact was
  enough to leave noticeable damage to his car's back left side.
- Shaken and confused, James got out of his car and walked over to the driver of the
  other vehicle, Lloyd Ussery. As he got closer, he noticed that Mr. Ussery was an
  older gentleman and seemed disoriented.
- '"Are you okay?" asked James.'
- '"I''m fine, son," Mr. Ussery replied.'
- James examined the damage to his car and then inspected Mr. Ussery's Cadillac Eldorado.
  The damage to the Cadillac was also extensive on its left side. James noticed that
  there were no airbags deployed in either vehicle, which made him feel a little relieved.
- '"Did you see what happened?" asked James.'
- '"I didn''t see anything," replied Mr. Ussery. "I just felt something hit me from
  behind."'
- James then went on to ask Mr. Ussery if he was okay and whether he needed medical
  attention or an ambulance. Mr. Ussery replied that he felt fine, but he agreed to
  wait for the police to arrive.
- While they waited, James called the San Antonio Police Department to report the
  accident. He provided them with all the details about what happened and requested
  that an officer come to take a report.
- During this time, witnesses started to approach the scene of the accident. One witness,
  in particular, approached James and stated that he had seen everything and would
  be willing to give a statement to the police.
- The police arrived at the scene within a few minutes, and James provided them with
  all the information they needed for their report. Based on James' statement and
  the witness's account, the police concluded that Mr. Ussery was at fault for the
  accident. They issued no citations, however, as Mr. Ussery was not conscious of
  his actions.
- After the police left, James called his insurance company to report the accident.
  He gave them all the details and requested an Carol to assess the damage to his
  car. He then returned home
